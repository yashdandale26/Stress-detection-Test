            <h2>Work For change</h2>
            <p>Jai hind.
              Work For Change! we are working on the toughest path that is "Change the world". Yes we know that 
                no one can change the world but, we are the one who look at the eyes of a fear. 
            We belive that there is only one way to change the world, that is "Change The Thought Process" 
            We belive youth have taht power to change the world.</p>
            <h3> Thoughts are : </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>  Petrotism </li>
             <li> Self empowernment </li>
             <li>  Worrior Mentality </li>
            </ul>
         
         <h2> Why YOUTH?</h2>
             <p>Because youth have that power, that energy, that aura to bring the Change.
             AT the age of 15-19 years, have that CONSTRUCTIVE as well as DESTRICTIVE Power. 
             At this age they can make an atom boom for the nation or they can become an atom boom for the nation. 
             They have to decide where they have to stand!</p>
             <h2>HOW TO BRING CHANGE</h2>
         
             <ul>
                <li>Inspire: Motivation can be a one-time thing but inspiration comes with real stories that people don't forget easily. We create that sense of realisation among people by inspiring them to speak out loud against the injustice happening to them. </li>
                <li> Team up: We make a team of passionate people who are ready to take initiative and feel proud to be a part of this generous deed of eradicating injustice from society. </li>
                <li>See and Act accordingly: An approach to see a thing matters the most. Our clear observation helps us to filter out a lot of things happening around us and find their best solutions.</li>
                <li> Being kind: A kindful gesture is the most loving way of communication. Being kind costs nothing but can bring priceless smiles to people around us. </li>
                 <li> Work on the thought Process: At the last working on the thought process is the best way to bring the change because we belive that thought power can change the world.</li>
              </ul>

                <h2>How thought power can change the world?</h2>
                <p>Let's start with a simple, if somewhat dramatic, example. If you thought that a 100' high tidal wave was going to hit your city in the next hour, what would you do? Would you listen to the news and hang around in your home or office? Hell, no! You would gather your loved ones and race to higher ground, even if it meant driving the wrong way down the highway or leaving everything you own on the sideway.

                    Belief changes everything.
                    
                    Now let's shift to a more complicated example. If you want to think your way to a more peaceful world, how would you begin?
                    
                    You'd start, I would hope, by finding peace within yourself. What shifts you towards anger, frustration, envy, or even self-criticism? You would need to understand the answers. How can you counterbalance those forces? You're not going to accomplish this by meditating once, or writing a few passages in your journal. It will take a ton of consistent effort and focus.
                    
                    You'd also shift your actions in the real world, perhaps by showing kindness to others whom you fear or dislike. You might skip your luxury vacation and work instead with gang members through a community center.
                    
                    What? Does working with gang members sound like a crazy thing to do?
                    
                    Perhaps you don't believe your own thoughts. Did you think it would be easy or trivial to make the world more peaceful?
                    
                    Powerful thoughts change the world, once they reach a certain consistent intensity. The true test is whether your thoughts are powerful enough to change your own actions.
                    
                    You've probably heard the story of Scott Harrison, a NYC club promoter who became the founder of the non-profit organization Charity: water. He had the thought to change the direction of his life, and started applying to work at major non-profits. They all turned him down, because of his partying background.
                    
                    Did he abandon his thought? No, he doubled down on it, kept working until someone said yes, and then expanded his vision once he realized just how great the need was for clean water.
                    
                    "I was running around telling everybody I wanted to see a world where everybody drank clean water regardless of where they are born," says Harrison via CNBC. He didn't just allow his thought to reside in his head; he shared it with everyone who would listen, including some who weren't inclined to listen.
                    
                    This is how your thought changes the world: when it is powerful enough that it takes you to northern Uganda and also compels you to sleep on floors while you raise money to help people you don't know.
                    
                    But wishes that you make while waiting in line at Starbucks? They don't change the world. In most cases, you have forgotten them after a few days or a week.
                    
                    To change the world, you need persistent and positive thoughts that are strong enough to change your own actions.
                    
                    In other words, before your thoughts can change the world, they must change you.</p>
